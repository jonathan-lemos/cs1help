        So you got a project, and you have no idea where to start.
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, read the project description. Often times it tells you a great deal about what to do.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you've read the project description and still don't know what to do, go to class. Often times your
                professor helps you complete the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                If that doesn't work, then try to divide the project into steps. You may not know how to make
                a rock-paper-scissors game in C, but you can probably make the function that reads rock, paper,
                or scissors from the user. You may get stuck on a few parts, but at least you'll have some of the
                project done
            </li>
            <li>
                If you can identify the general things you need to implement, but not how to implement them,
                then try <a href={"#coming-soon"}>Googling</a> how to do things. <q>how do i do something forever
                in C</q>, and <q>how do i do a while loop in bash</q> are appropriate questions to Google, but
                <q>how do i do rock paper scissors in C</q> is not.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you cannot identify even a few things to do, then we've got quite the problem here, chief.
                At this point, you could try <a href={"#computerscience1-whatdoido-askinggoodquestions"}>asking
                questions</a>. Be honest about your predicament; don't say "How do I do rock paper scissors in C?";
                instead, say "I have no idea where to start with CS1 project 2."
            </li>
            <li>
                If you really don't give a shit about learning or being a competent human being, you could try
                copying the project off someone who actually knows what they're doing, or off someone who knows
                someone who knows what they're doing. This will get you through the project (if you don't get caught),
                but won't get you through future projects, tests, classes, and life, as programming skills build off
                each other and if you can't do the current project, you're dead in the water for projects in the future.
                The probability you get caught copying one project is basically nothing, but if you're incompetent,
                you stick out like a sore thumb and assuming you actually cheat your way through all 30+ projects, in
                the best case scenario you're stuck with a job you hate and don't know how to do.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

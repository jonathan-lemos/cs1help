            All you wanted to do is slap some code on a page and make sparks fly,
            but you got <i>that</i> professor who kind of assumes you already know how to code and now you're screwed.
            That's why this webpage exists. Below are a series of short and to-the-point articles that quickly
            explain the concepts you need to get enough partial credit on your projects to pass the class.
